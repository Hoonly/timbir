The Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (`TIMBIR <https://github.com/adityamnk/timbir.git>`_) [:cite:`mohan2015timbir`,  :cite:`mohan2015mbir`] is a method for 4D time-space reconstruction of data acquired using synchrotron X-ray computed tomography. TIMBIR is a synergistic combination of two innovations. The first innovation, interlaced view sampling, is a novel method of data acquisition which distributes the view angles more evenly in time. The second innovation is a 4D model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm (MBIR) which can produce time-resolved volumetric reconstruction of the sample from the interlaced views. In addition to modeling both the sensor noise statistics and the 4D object, the MBIR algorithm also reduces ring and streak artifacts by more accurately modeling the measurement non-idealities [:cite:`mohan2015timbir`,  :cite:`mohan2015mbir`, :cite:`mohan2014`].
