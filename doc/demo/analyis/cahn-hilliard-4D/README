Reconstruction of a phantom generated using the Cahn-Hilliard equation

** SUMMARY **
This is a simple example to demonstrate 4D reconstruction of a time varying phantom using simulated data.

** HOW? **
- Compile the code in /Source_Code/MBIR_4D and /Source_Code/reconstruct/basic as explained in the top-level README
- Read /Source_Code/reconstruct/basic/README for instructions to run the reconstruction code and to understand the command line options.
- Run run.sh.
	It uses 'mpiexec' as the MPI launcher. Otherwise, use the appropriate MPI launcher in your environment.
	mpiexec -n 1 -machinefile nodefile ../../Source_Code/reconstruct/basic/XT_Main --proj_rows 4 --proj_cols 256 --proj_num 1024 --recon_num 32 --vox_wid 1 --rot_center 132 --sig_s 0.02 --sig_t 0.001 --c_s 0.00001 --c_t 0.00001 --convg_thresh 1 --remove_rings 3 --quad_convex
	NOTE: THE REGULARIZATION PARAMETERS USED IN THIS EXAMPLE ARE NOT OPTIMAL. IT IS JUST A WORKING CASE.
	Here the projection and weight data is of size 1024 x 4 x 256. The center of rotation is 132. The number of reconstruction time samples is 32. The regularization parameters, sig_s, sig_t, c_s, c_t, are chosen appropriately. The convergence threshold is 1%. We correct for ring artifacts using type-3 ring correction.
