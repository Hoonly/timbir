Reconstruction of Shepp-Logan phantom

** SUMMARY **
This is a simple example to demonstrate the reconstruction of a Shepp-Logan phantom from projection data.

** HOW? **
- Compile the code in /Source_Code/MBIR_4D and /Source_Code/reconstruct/basic as explained in the top-level README
- Read /Source_Code/reconstruct/basic/README for instructions to run the reconstruction code and to understand the command line options.
- Run run.sh.
	It uses 'mpiexec' as the MPI launcher. Otherwise, use the appropriate MPI launcher in your environment.
	mpiexec -n 1 -machinefile nodefile ./XT_Main --proj_rows 24 --proj_cols 512 --proj_num 256 --recon_num 1 --vox_wid 1 --rot_center 256 --sig_s 0.01 --sig_t 1 --c_s 0.00001 --c_t 0.00001 --convg_thresh 1 --remove_rings 0 --remove_streaks 0
	Here the projection and weight data is of size 256 x 24 x 512. The center of rotation is 256. Since we are doing 3D reconstruction, the number of reconstruction time samples is 1. The regularization parameters, sig_s, sig_t, c_s, c_t, are chosen appropriately. The convergence threshold is 1%. Also, we do not correct for ring and streak artifacts.
